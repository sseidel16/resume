## Professional Highlights & Stories

### AI Chat Service at Ring
Led the complete development of ring.com's AI-powered chat service, handling architecture, UI design, backend implementation, and AI integration. The service now processes over 3 million messages weekly with 200,000+ AI-powered interactions, bringing generative AI to customer support at scale.

### Secure File Transfer System
Designed and implemented a secure file upload system where security was a first-class concern from day one. Implemented end-to-end encryption, isolated containers for each upload, and intelligent media detection. This system handles sensitive customer data with military-grade security.

### Security Vulnerability Discoveries
As Application Security Certifier at Amazon Ring (2021-2023), ran security certifications for multiple critical systems:
- Ring Marlin camera firmware - found and eliminated multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities
- Alexa Bluetooth firmware libraries on IoT devices
- Alexa target determination services (responsible for determining which Alexa device to trigger)
- Ring camera firmwares

Discovered critical buffer overflow vulnerabilities that could have had severe consequences. Successfully worked with development teams to remediate issues before they reached production. Used BurpSuite, Fortify, and Wireshark for comprehensive security analysis.

### Autonomous Vehicle Competition
One of the most memorable achievements from university days: the autonomous car racing competition where only 3 teams out of the entire cohort successfully completed the race, and Stephen's vehicle crossed the finish line first. The project required integrating multiple Arduinos, LIDAR sensors, implementing adaptive speed control, and creating fault-tolerant sensor fusion algorithms—all working together in real-time under competitive conditions.

### High-Frequency Trading Parser Development (Prognos Trading LLC)
As a contractor, singly implemented initial hyper-efficient C++ parsers and book builder for 12 cryptocurrency exchanges for high-frequency trading systems. Implementation included:
- Connecting to websockets for real-time market data
- Zero-copy JSON parsing for minimal latency
- Cache-optimized storage structures
- Lock-free data structures

Focused on extreme low-latency requirements enabling microsecond-level decision making. Did not perform actual trading, but built the critical infrastructure that traders relied upon.

### GraphQL Benchmarking & Performance (Summer 2018)
During internship at American Express, developed and compared GraphQL servers in Spring Boot, Node.js, and Vert.x to evaluate performance across different technology stacks. Conducted extensive benchmarking and optimization of GraphQL implementations, identifying performance bottlenecks and implementing solutions for high-throughput scenarios. Also provided GraphQL training sessions for company developers to spread knowledge across the organization.

### SolutionStart Technologies Experience
Internship at a technology services company where compensation included a high-end laptop (i7 processor, 8GB RAM, valued at $2000+). Gained hands-on experience with hardware setup, server configuration, and client-facing support. The company eventually went bankrupt, but the experience provided valuable early career lessons about startup environments and client services.

### Educational Path Choice
Made the deliberate decision to pursue Systems Engineering instead of Computer Science despite already being a proficient programmer. The goal was to gain deep hardware knowledge—circuits, digital design, FPGAs, robotics—to understand computers from the silicon up, not just from the API down. This decision shaped a unique skill set bridging hardware and software.
