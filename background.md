## Professional Highlights & Stories

### AI Chat Service at Ring
Led the complete development of ring.com's AI-powered chat service, handling architecture, UI design, backend implementation, and AI integration. The service now processes over 3 million messages weekly with 200,000+ AI-powered interactions, bringing generative AI to customer support at scale.

### Secure File Transfer System
Designed and implemented a secure file upload system where security was a first-class concern from day one. Implemented end-to-end encryption, isolated containers for each upload, and intelligent media detection. This system handles sensitive customer data with military-grade security.

### Security Vulnerability Discoveries
During time as Application Security Certifier, discovered critical buffer overflow vulnerabilities that could have had severe consequences. Successfully worked with development teams to remediate issues before they reached production.

### Autonomous Vehicle Competition
One of the most memorable achievements from university days: the autonomous car racing competition where only 3 teams out of the entire cohort successfully completed the race, and Stephen's vehicle crossed the finish line first. The project required integrating multiple Arduinos, LIDAR sensors, implementing adaptive speed control, and creating fault-tolerant sensor fusion algorithms—all working together in real-time under competitive conditions.

### High-Frequency Trading Parser Development
Built zero-copy parsers for high-frequency cryptocurrency trading systems. Focused on extreme low-latency requirements, cache optimization, and lock-free data structures. Did not perform actual trading, but built the critical infrastructure enabling microsecond-level decision making.
